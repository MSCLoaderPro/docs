var sequence = [ 38, 38, 40, 40, 37, 39, 37, 39, 66, 65 ];
var position = 0;

document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.keyCode == sequence[position]) {
        position++;
        if (position >= sequence.length) {
            window.location.href = "#/Snake.md";
        }
    }
    else {
        position = 0;
    }
});

## Note on WineHQ compatibility

The ModLoaderPro injects it's code to the game using `winhttp` library thus on UNIX systems utilizing the WineHQ compatibility layer it's important to set `winhttp` library as `native` (e.g. in command `winecfg` -> `Library` tab) for wine to use our library otherwise the mod won't initialize due to wine using it's `builtin` library without our code injection.
