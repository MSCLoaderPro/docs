# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why switch to Mod Loader Pro?

If you are a player, Mod Loader Pro loads mods faster, allows you to update mods automatically<sup>1</sup> (for mods that support it), allows you to login into NexusMods, requires minimum input to update the Mod Loader Pro and has a beautifully crafted interface matching My Summer Car's interface.

If you are a modder, Mod Loader Pro offers a very flexible environment for your new mods - an advanced, extensive and easy to use API, that lets you create any mod - from simple "Hello, World!", to a brand new vehicles. Mod Loader API is continuously being expanded and with each update it only gets better!

## If I switch to Mod Loader Pro, do I loose anything?

Absolutely not! Your game save is left untouched and in almost all cases, your mods, mod progress and configs will be still there, untouched.

## Will my mods work?

Absolutely most, if not all! Only in some very rare cases, mod may not be compatible,.

Also, mods such as [Tangerine FZ-120](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/176) or [Modern Optimization Plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/146) have been updated to Mod Loader Pro, in order to fully utilise new features that Mod Loader Pro offers.

## Do I have to do anything while moving from MSCLoader to Mod Loader Pro?

Nope! Mod Loader Pro Installer does everything for you and configure itself automatically.

## Windows Defender detected the Installer as a virus

It is caused by the fact that Installer is a new piece of software and is not recognised by basically any anti virus software.

This is a false positive and there is nothing to be worried about.

## What is CoolUpdater.exe?

CoolUpdater acts as a middle-man between My Summer Car and NexusMods or GitHub. Because My Summer Car uses a very outdated version of Unity engine, it doesn't support modern network security protocols. CoolUpdater gets around that by doing all external communication - it downloads mod data from NexusMods, downloads mod updates and so on.

## How is my NexusMods API key stored?

NexusMods API is **ONLY** used to communicate with NexusMods itself and is stored encrypted right on your computer.

## Does Mod Loader Pro know my password to NexusMods?

No, Mod Loader Pro uses NexusMods Single Sign-On (SSO). It is NexusMods that handles all the authentication.
